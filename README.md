## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to make an accordion with JavaScript, how to use overflow: hidden on images except one, how to place elements more accurate with position relative and absolute, how to use more accurately margins, paddings etc... Since my first project, I think my responsive skills improved too. Even if there is still lot of work to do !

### Continued development

I want to continue my progression in every aspect of building webpages, and be more efficient.

### Useful resources


- [https://www.w3schools.com] - Use it for some searches and reminders, and for the accordion method.
- [https://stackoverflow.com/ ] - Use for some information about the font-weight in my buttons, and to overflow hidden some images except one.
